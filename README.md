Use a Light Base: Employ predominantly white or light-colored backgrounds to create a clean, expansive feel.
Accent with Strategic Colors: Utilize one or two vibrant colors from the brand palette for highlights, buttons, and important features, ensuring they meet accessibility standards for visibility and contrast.
Optimize Text Clarity: Use black and grey for text to enhance readability, with type sizes and weights varied to establish a clear visual hierarchy.
Ensure Responsiveness: Design for a seamless experience across all devices, with layouts that adapt and perform well regardless of screen size.
Manage Whitespace Effectively: Use ample whitespace to avoid visual clutter, promoting a layout thatâ€™s breathable and comfortable, even if it requires more scrolling.
Use Images and Icons Purposefully: Incorporate images and icons that support content and user navigation without distraction, ensuring they are optimized for quick load times.
Streamline Navigation: Implement a simple, top-aligned navigation bar with clear categories. Keep the footer minimal, organizing essential links for easy navigation.
Highlight CTAs: Design call-to-action buttons in standout colors that contrast sharply with the background, making them easy to locate.
Emphasize Key Information: Strategically use size, color, and placement to highlight critical information or actions, ensuring all interactive elements are accessible and provide clear feedback.
